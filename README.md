# train-delay-predictor
This is a Machine Learning project which tries to predict the delay in arrival of trains in the Indian Railway Network.

We deployed Random Forest, SVM and Polynomial Regression for delay predictions. For in depth analysis of results and insite into the methodology adopted, please look into the Report PDF.
